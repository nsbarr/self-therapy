      <description>For several months, I&amp;rsquo;ve been building and using a self-therapy practice environment based on the Internal Family Systems (IFS) model. I&amp;rsquo;ve found it very useful, and after some early positive feedback, I think others might find it useful, too.
IFS changed my life when I first started working with it in 2020. It is a wonderfully empowering therapy that says we all have a Self; a vast, powerful resource for healing and transformation.</description>
