      <title>Enhancing Self-Therapy with Internal Family Systems and AI</title>

      <description>For several months, I&amp;rsquo;ve been prototyping an AI-powered therapy tool. It&amp;rsquo;s proven surprisingly useful, so I want to share it with you here.
Many people are experimenting with AI for therapy, but the tool I&amp;rsquo;ve built takes advantage of unusual structural properties in the Internal Family Systems (IFS) model.
Unlike many therapeutic modalities, IFS comes with a user manual. The role of the therapist is not to diagnose or to heal the client, but rather to guide them step-by-step through the relevant protocols.</description>
