      So we have your question now: What am I doing here? Is that your question now? What am I doing here? Well, I’m sitting on a chair. Or I’m listening… I’m listening to crazy talk *[laughter]*. Nonsense, nonsense crazy talk.

      Anyway. I’m sitting on a chair. Or, I’m listening to a talk *[he laughs]*. Yeti from Nepal. Yeti? Snowball man. Snowball man from Nepal. Anyway. Talking from the throne. Anyway. 
      
      *[he laughs]* Snowball man *[laughter]*. From Mount Everest.

      Anyway. So: I am listening to a talk, or sitting on a chair. Or I’m sitting on the throne, giving a talk. Crazy talk.
    commentary: |
      In this opening section, Rinpoche begins by questioning the ordinary perception of what we think we're doing. He uses humor and seemingly nonsensical language to break our habitual patterns of thinking, setting the stage for examining how we perceive the "I" that is performing actions like sitting or listening.

    transcript: |
      So we see “I”, “I’m sitting on a chair,” or listening to a talk, we see the appearance of a real “I” is there. A real “I” abiding or existing in this body. 

      Without examining then, you see, the natural beliefs that, as I mentioned the other day, inside the chest. Not in the stomach, where there’s all the… junks. Junks? Well the, if it’s after lunch or dinner, you know, joking, but not in the stomach, with the food, all the junks, the poopoo *[laughter]*, not there, but not inside the head. Not here, inside the head *[holding head forward in both hands]* or inside the face, you see, not there you see, but inside the chest.
      
    commentary: |
      Rinpoche explores how we naturally believe in a real 'I' that seems to exist somewhere inside the body. He points out how we typically think of this "I" as residing in the chest area, not in the stomach or head. Without examination, we believe this "I" is what sits on the chair or listens to teachings. This highlights our default view of an inherently existing self.

    transcript: |
      So anyway, when we’re not examining the real “I”, that real I sitting on the chair or listening to the talk, so then you say: Why believe? Why do I say this, “I am sitting on a chair listening to a talk?” Why say this? Why do I believe this?

      Then the answer is: there’s nothing else. No other reason at all except the aggregates of the body. The action, doing sitting. So: that’s it, you know? That’s it, then believed. Labeled, and believed. I am sitting on a chair. That’s it.

      Or the aggregates, the mind and sensory ear is paying attention to listening to a talk. So the base, the aggregates base, you know? The sense, the consciousness, the ear, paying attention to the talk. So that’s it, nothing else.
      
      There’s nothing else other than that. Why I say I believe I’m saying, listening to the teaching, nothing else. There’s no other reason at all. Nothing else. Nothing more than that.
      
      So when you think the reason, when you put the reason, why you believe why you say I’m sitting on a chair, or listening to a talk, relating to the aggregates, relating to the base the aggregates what function it does, that’s it. That’s it, nothing else but that.
      
      That’s it. No other reason, at all.
    commentary: |
      Here Rinpoche begins the analytical meditation by questioning why we believe "I am sitting" or "I am listening." He guides us to recognize that the only basis for these statements is the aggregates (body and mind) performing their functions. The body sits, the ear consciousness pays attention - these are the only reasons we label "I" and believe "I am doing something." This is a crucial point in understanding dependent arising.

    title: "The Apparently Real \"I\" is Not Found in the Aggregates"
    start_time: 432.00
    end_time: 552.54
    transcript: |
      So when you think the base to be labeled “I” is the aggregates: existing merely, then doing a function sitting, and then the sense ear consciousness paying attention to the talk, so when you just think that, then that real “I”, what you believed before, what appears is true, you see, so basically, you know, it’s gone. 
      
      Not there. 
      
      Nonexistent. You see, not there, nonexistent.

      That real “I”, you know, before, sitting, and listening, it’s not there. It’s gone. Not gone out, not gone in the car [laughter], not escaped, not that. You see: you know, it doesn’t exist. It’s not there. And the view of your mind is not there. Suddenly, you see, total change to your mind. Your perception is totally changed. 
    commentary: |
      Rinpoche explains that when we actually analyze and recognize that the only basis for the "I" is the aggregates performing their functions, we realize that the seemingly "real I" that we believed in before - the inherently existing self - is simply not there. It's not that it went somewhere; it's that we discover it never existed in the first place. This realization produces a radical change in perception.

    transcript: |
      Suddenly, there’s huge differences. You know what is believed by the wrong concept, ignorance, that there’s a real I there inside this body, or that you know on these aggregates existing from its own side, not immediately labeled by mind. So strongly believed it’s true. So strongly 100% believed. Suddenly: not there. 
      
      Suddenly doesn’t exist.
    commentary: |
      In this brief but crucial section, Rinpoche highlights the dramatic difference between what we believed before analysis (a real, independently existing "I" inside the body) and what we discover through examination. What we believed with 100% conviction turns out to be non-existent when properly analyzed.

    transcript: |
      So just, you know, just mind made it up. Mind made it up. The label I. Mind made up the label I, and believed. Mind merely imputed I and believed in that, and its function. Mind merely imputed self, and then merely imputed the action, the function sitting, listening to the talk, all that, merely imputed by mind you see. Mind just made it up. Mind just made up the label and merely imputed the I, merely imputed the action sitting on the chair, listening to the talk. That’s it. That’s it, nothing else. 
      
      So something that came from the mind, you see. Relating to the aggregates, mind just made up the label “I” then merely imputed the action listening to talk or sitting on the chair, so that’s it. Believed in that, you see.

    commentary: |
      Rinpoche explains that the "I" is merely imputed by the mind in dependence upon the aggregates. Not only is the "I" merely imputed, but also all its actions and functions. The mind makes up the label "I" and then also imputes "sitting" or "listening" in relation to the aggregates. This dependent existence is how the self actually exists, in contrast to the independent, inherent self we believed in before.

    transcript: |
      So therefore, so therefore, that’s what exists. Therefore, the other one that you believed before, before examining why I believe I’m sitting, I’m listening you see, so after you put the reasons, you know, relating to the aggregates, nothing else. So relating to the aggregates, what they do, that’s it.

      So, different phenomena. It’s different phenomena, body aggregates doing action sitting, then the mind sense of ear consciousness paying attention to talk. So different phenomena. You use other phenomena you see. So that’s the reason.

      So that’s it. Nothing else than that.

      So you see: what appeared what you believed before: a real I in the sense existing from on its own side inside this body or on these aggregates, from above these aggregates, there’s a real I existing from its own side not merely imputed by mind and believed, you see by mind that it’s true.

      So that, so that, so that you know, that’s not there. That’s non existent. Non existent. 

    commentary: |
      Here Rinpoche emphasizes that the body, consciousness, and senses are different phenomena upon which the "I" is labeled. He contrasts this with our previous belief in a "real I" that exists "from its own side" (independently) within or on top of the aggregates, not merely labeled by mind.

      So that, so it proves. So it proves. So it proves that previous concept is wrong. Appearance is a hallucination. Previous appearance a hallucination. That’s false view of, false I. That previous one. 
      
      That’s the view of the false I. That object’s been refuted. *gag-ja*, anyway you see.

      gakcha and the mind which believes that's true. That's ignorance. That's ignorance, root of samsara, root of all the root of all the delusions, from all the delusions and karma, all the from where that from, where which results, which results suffering, death, which results suffering. But you know, all the old ages, sicknesses, and dissatisfactions, all the mental, physical problems, so everything which results for that see,

      so the oceans of human beings suffering. You know, oceans of Sura Asura, helping animals, individuals, all these oceans of all they suffer, all those real sufferings. She comes so from this, from this, from this very nonsense, from this nonsense. Mind, this mind concept nonsense, you know, child, childish nonsense, nonsense, concept nonsense, you know nonsense, totally, total, no meaning you know this, believing I which doesn't exist, believing I so which doesn't exist, It will not there. So believe is

      the root of ignorance, the root of all, for where all the delusion comes, you know, all the wrong concepts, the 60 root delusion trend. I mean the elaborating the eight of 1000 delusion. Hyper the Buddha taught eight of 1000 8 of 1000 Dharma, teaching the remedy to eight of 1000 delusions, However, so you know, yeah, so from This, this concept. Steve
    commentary: |
      Rinpoche explains that the false view of an inherently existing self is a hallucination, and the mind that believes in this false view is ignorance - the root of samsara. From this ignorance come all delusions, karma, and the resulting suffering experienced by all beings. He emphasizes that this seemingly profound source of suffering is actually based on something completely nonsensical - believing in an "I" that doesn't exist at all.

      And the mind that believes it’s true, that’s ignorance. That’s ignorance. Roof of samsara. Root of all the delusions, the 12 delusions and karma. From which results suffering, death. Which results suffering, rebirth. And then old age sicknesses, and dissatisfactions. All the mental problems, So everything results all that, you see.

      So the oceans of human beings suffering, oceans of asura, hell beings, hungry ghosts, animals, in the intermediate state, all these oceans of suffering, from which it comes.

      From this… from this… from this very nonsense. From this nonsense mind. This mind concept is nonsense. Kinda like [laughs], childish nonsense. Nonsense concept. Laughs. You know. Nonsense. 

      Uh. 

      Totally no meaning. You know, Believing I which doesn’t exist. Believing I, self, which doesn’t exist. Which is not there. So the root of ignorance laughs from which all the delusion comes, all the wrong concepts, the 60 root delusions the .. elaborate, 84,000 delusions where buddha taught 84,000 dharma teachings you know, remedy to the 84,000 delusions, however… so.. you know. Yeah.

      Yeah, believing, bleeping, ah, the hallucination you see there's a real eye inside this body or on the on this, I guess it. Existing from society, not merely labeled by not merely labeled by mind, so

      Uh, you see. 

      And it’s truly. I say, I say, I say, you know absolutely completely believed that this is true. Completely entrust this. 100%. No doubt. But this concept is wrong concept. Ignorance. Ignorance. Because. Why it’s ignorance? Because there’s no such I there. Even an atom of that does not exist. There’s not even an atom of that existing in this body or on these aggregates. Nowhere you can find. Mm

      There's no atom of that exist in this body, or in this body, or on these areas. Nowhere you can find.
    commentary: |
      Rinpoche elaborates on how we completely trust the appearance of an inherently existing self, believing it 100% without doubt. He emphasizes that this view is wrong because such a self cannot be found anywhere - not even an atom of it exists in the body or on the aggregates. He circles back to the simple meditation technique of questioning why we believe "I am sitting" or "I am listening," which reveals that there is nothing beyond the aggregates performing their functions.

      So, just very simple. Very simple meditation. Very simple meditation this. You question to yourself: Why I believe why I say I’m sitting on a chair listening to the teaching. Then related to the aggregates what function the aggregate does. That’s it, nothing else. Nothing more than that. Can’t find anything other than that.
      
      So then you see, just by that, then the previous “real I” in this body, believed 100% true, you discover, (train howls past) hm! Hm. You see: nonexistent. Hm. Can’t find. So this is one meditation, one technique, that you can use to recognize the gak-cha, the object that’s been refuted. 

      So now here, then you recognize the privilege one that there was a real eye, and you see, during all this real action of listening and real action of sitting on chair, see the object which is a False the Yeah, which doesn't exist at all. So to recognize the object we refuted today, it helps, then the letter, then let when you then let her, then let her say, when your mind, just take your mind staying this reason, as long as we understand this, this reason You see, maintaining the reason it helps there,
    commentary: |
      Here Rinpoche introduces the concept of the "object to be refuted" (gakcha in Tibetan). This is the inherently existing self that appears to us but does not actually exist. He explains that the meditation technique he's teaching helps us to recognize this false object so that we can then refute it, and emphasizes the importance of maintaining focus on the reasoning in our meditation.

      to not, to not see that real. I you know the existence from side appearing that is the belief to not look, to not look at that. And then. But when your mind distracted, when your mind is distracted from these concentration, then they come back. You see a real eye in this body. And rely, to make it short, in the real eye, the sense existing from society. See on this, on this, I guess, from above this, I guess believed by one's mind, by the ignorance, you see, that 100% true,

      so that so, so you again, so again, you question. See, oh, they put you put the reason relating to, I guess you know, relating to the different, not different phenomena there, I could get to see what actually does. Then, when you do that, when you when you use this reason, you see. So then again, that false I not there in the view your mind, so that, so you're able to help to able to recognize the object, to be refuted the gakcha you see, so that, so more and more you're able to also say, Hmm,

      this is what. This is what doesn't exist at all. See, the more you're able to recognize the false i, then it's a, then it's a, then it is a minute, then it is a minute. See, to realize it is empty. It is it is empty, totally empty as it is empty, totally non accident, as it is Total, non accident, so empty, So that, so The i
    commentary: |
      Rinpoche explains that maintaining focus on the reasoning helps prevent the false view from returning. However, when our mind gets distracted from concentration, the appearance of an inherently existing self returns. When this happens, we need to apply the reasoning again by questioning the basis of our belief. The more we practice recognizing the false "I," the closer we come to realizing emptiness - the total non-existence of the inherently existing self.

      so when the body is sitting and I guess the body is doing the action sitting, the the mind is the mind the sense of the air, the consciousness is listening, then, Then, then, the mind seeing that just merely imputed. I just just made up the label I then see and the actions of the eye, meeting the walking, sitting or sitting or listening just the merely imputed, but merely by mind just being imputed by mind. Believe that That's it. Nothing else.

      So, so. I, which is so i, which is existing, the self I which exists, is something. It is something unbelievable, unbelievable. Subtle. Unbelievable, subtle. What? How the I Exist, what it is or what is self is something unbelievable, subtle, unbelievable, subtle phenomena.

      It's like, doesn't exist. Is not it is not. It is not said it doesn't exist. But it's like that the light doesn't exist. Unbelievable, unbelievable, subtle. What's the eat? What's really to it? Unbelievable.
    commentary: |
      After the meditation, Rinpoche returns to explain the correct view of the self. The self that actually exists is merely imputed by the mind upon the aggregates. This correct understanding of the self is described as "unbelievably subtle" - so subtle that it's almost like it doesn't exist, but it's not that it doesn't exist at all. This subtlety is difficult to grasp and points to the Middle Way view that avoids both the extreme of inherent existence and the extreme of nihilistic non-existence.

      Subtle. So mind just merely imputed the meditation, the subtle dependent arising going to prasangika school, Madhyama school, prasangika school, fourth school, Madhyama School, which is true thought under the school, prasangika school. So prasangika school view the dependent arising, this subtle dependent dependent arising, subtle dependent arising. I may immediately imputed it about the mind.

      So the minute to mental exactly to meditate, concentrate exactly in the meaning of that is extremely important. Not, not just, not just say, oh, immediately by mind, it just leave it. Not like that, you know, you just throw the words under it. You just throw the words and then you don't manage it. Doesn't help. You see, one has to meditate Exactly. One has to one has to meditate exactly on the words. Then Then, then it's really, then it's then it's unbelievable, fantastic.
    commentary: |
      Rinpoche identifies this subtle view of dependent arising as belonging to the Prasangika Madhyamaka school, which he describes as the "true thought" or highest philosophical school in Buddhism. He emphasizes that it's not enough to just intellectually understand or verbalize that the "I" is "merely imputed by mind" - one must meditate exactly on the meaning of these words to gain the profound realization.

      Then you come to know that how subbtle it is, the cells are. You see. So like that. So, so you get the first example how it is so extremely subtle. You know, it exists, but it's extremely fine, unbelievable, subtle. Light doesn't exist, so like that. So once you get it, once you get that clear experience of this, then all

      HF, I guess each of the targets, the same in their body and mind, all the rest of phenomena like that, hell, enlightenment, SAMSA, nivana, happiness, problem, all, there is a phenomenon like that. See, it's all empty. It's all everything was, everything. What you think real, everything what you think, what do you believe, real for real from a society. I say, everything, what you everything, what appears, what you believe it is there. It is there on the base. Is everything there on the base. See which is also labeled by your medieval, by your mind. So it's not there.

      Everything is not there on the base, not there on the base as appeared as you believe. It's not true at all. Everything, everything are totally you see, empty, the mere mere conception, see, merely merely believe. It merely merely believed. That's it, nothing else, even the base, when you say label, is immediately by mind, believed, see, that's it. So.

      Ah. So you can see everything came from the mind, even the mind itself. So everything is empty. Empty means do not exist from their own side. I action object, I do not exist from side. Action do not exist from side. Object do not exist from side. Everything do not exist. Everything do not exist from the outside. Everything are totally empty

      just A minute Liberty here I the first I empty, then second action, third objects. So meditate, meditate like that. First I empty, 10 actions, then your actions, all the activities, then All the objects, okay, maintain like that. Enter This. I
    commentary: |
      In this concluding section, Rinpoche extends the understanding of emptiness from the self to all phenomena. Once we gain clear experience of the emptiness of the self, we can apply this understanding to everything else - including not only ordinary objects but also more abstract concepts like samsara, nirvana, happiness, and problems. All phenomena are empty of inherent existence, existing merely as mental labels. Even the bases upon which we impute labels are themselves merely labeled by mind. He concludes with practical meditation instructions: first meditate on the emptiness of the "I," then on the emptiness of actions, and finally on the emptiness of objects.
