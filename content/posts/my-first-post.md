For several months, I've been building and using a self-therapy practice environment based on the Internal Family Systems (IFS) model. I've found it very useful, and after some early positive feedback, I think others might find it useful, too.

IFS changed my life when I first started working with it in 2020. It is a wonderfully empowering therapy that says we all have a Self; a vast, powerful resource for healing and transformation. IFS is unusual for its highly structured protocol - while there is tremendous freedom to explore, there are also well-defined procedures and a clear roadmap. As a result, a therapist can be a helpful guide, but is not required. Many people practice IFS with a partner, or by themselves. My own entry into IFS was the book *Self-Therapy*{{< sidenote >}}Jay Earley, [Self-Therapy](https://amzn.to/44bUY7G) (2009).{{< /sidenote >}} which gives readers a user manual for beginning to heal themselves safely and effectively.

As we’ll see, self-therapy is not easy to do. When you're trying to feel your feelings, you don't want to have to worry about staying on track or writing down insights. This is where the practice environment comes in.{{< marginnote >}}![Abacus](/abacus.png)Some technologies help us think, like the abacus. They afford new abilities that we eventually internalize. David Krakauer [calls these](/krakauer.pdf) complementary cognitive artifacts. Others do the thinking for us, like a calculator. They free us up, but cannibalize our abilities. Krakauer calls these competitive cognitive artifacts.{{< /marginnote >}}  It enables the individual to focus on the most important work – exploring their inner world – and takes over the supporting tasks. 

The system makes use of various AI technologies, including ChatGPT. But the way it uses these technologies is novel. Most AI-assisted mental health applications connect individuals to a chatbot, which performs the role of therapist, or compassionate friend. Instead, this system uses ChatGPT to unobtrusively augment and expand one’s inner work. Following the principles of IFS, the practice environment is in service of the individual's ability to access their Self-energy, and careful not to proffer a crutch without which they cannot stand on their own.

The practice environment relies entirely on the protocols of the IFS model, which have been validated and refined over forty years. It aspires only to operationalize those protocols in a novel way that is more effective than worksheets and more available than human partners. My wish for this work is that it helps more people learn about IFS, develop a self-therapy practice, and build their capacity for healing and transformation.

### Graphing the internal social network

Developed in the 1980s by Richard Schwartz, IFS is grounded in the observation that the mind is naturally multiple, housing a variety of subpersonalities, or "parts.” We experience this multiplicity when we feel torn between conflicting desires; maybe part of us wants to pursue a challenging opportunity, but another part fears the risk, while a third part feels exhausted by the inner debate. 

These parts are distinct entities within us, each with their unique characteristics, desires, and roles. In the IFS model, parts are categorized into “Exiles” and “Protectors.” Exiles are wounded parts that carry burdens, often rooted in past trauma, and Protectors shield Exiles to keep the individual in a state of equilibrium.

Central to IFS is the "Self,” or “Self-energy,” which is viewed as the individual's true nature. Schwartz throws out several “C”s to characterize what it’s like when you are “in Self”: you may find that you’re calm, clear, curious, compassionate, creative, courageous, connected. The Self isn’t a part; it’s a vast resource, always available and impossible to damage. The Self is compatible with spiritual traditions, which might use language like soul, God, or natural awareness. But the Self is also no big deal; you’re in Self multiple times a day when you are speaking honestly or when you’re just there with someone, open and listening.

>}}

To practice IFS is to build a relationship between your Self and your parts. More specifically: as the Self gets to know Protectors, they begin to reveal their beliefs, fears, and how they function on behalf of the individual. In turn, the Self acknowledges the roles these protective parts have been playing, and gives them hope that there’s a better way forward. 

Having earned the trust of Protectors, the Self can do deep work with an Exile – a part, usually stuck in the individual’s past, with a powerful memory and a story to tell. When the Exile is able to tell their story, and feels fully witnessed by the Self, they may be prepared to let go of their burdens and limiting beliefs, and re-connect with the positive qualities that had been lost. After the Exile is healed, Protectors discover that they can drop their old roles and take on new responsibilities as well.
{{< marginnote >}}![Stardew Valley](/stardew-valley.jpg) Games like Harvest Moon, and [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/), pictured, belong to the "cozy sim" genre. They provide a bucolic environment in which the player can fish, garden, and tend to animals. {{< /marginnote >}}
This is the “internal family system”; a web of interdependent parts supported by a loving presence, the Self. You could also think of the system as an organization headed up by a benevolent CEO, or even, as I sometimes do, as animals led by a kind shepherd. (I would love for therapy to feel more like playing Harvest Moon; more on that later.)

### The Path to Self-Leadership

From this brief overview, the shape of the practice emerges. Session to session, the work is for the individual's Self to form or deepen a relationship with a part. That's the method. Over time, the individual befriends their Protectors, heals their Exiles, and becomes Self-led; that is, they always dwell in and act from Self-energy. That's the purpose.

In many ways, IFS is shaped more like a spiritual practice than a therapy modality. I have experience with both. When I did psychodynamic therapy, my therapist's office was the container for our work. Sessions were unstructured by design, and were impossible to conduct alone – they required the two of us. In contrast, my nondual meditation practice harmonizes very well with IFS. Like IFS, meditation points to a vast, powerful resource, sometimes called natural awareness. Like IFS, a guide is very helpful in meditation, but can't do the meditating for you. And like IFS, a daily practice is the best way to progress with meditation.

But where meditation or prayer are relatively simple activities, IFS can be quite tricky. For example, consider the “6 Fs,” a protocol for building a relationship between Self and a part. The 6 Fs are:

1. **Find.** The individual turns their attention inwards and finds what’s happening inside by locating an emotion, thought, or body sensation they want to work with.
2. **Focus.** The individual gathers their attention around this internal part.
3. **Flesh out.** The individual learns basic details about the part: its name, what it looks like, what it’s saying, etc.
4. **Feel.** The individual checks how they feel toward the part before going any further. If they feel open, curious, compassionate, etc., then they continue. If they are feeling judgment, aversion, or just going blank, it means they are “blended,” or partially taken over by another part. They either reconnect with Self-energy, or switch focus to that part.
5. **Befriend.** The individual learns more about how the part operates: what is the job it does, how long has it been doing that job, how it feels about that job, etc.
6. **Fears.** The individual learns what fears the part has by asking what is it scared would happen if it stopped doing its job. The individual validates and negotiates those fears, giving the part hope that they can show them alternative ways of caring for their system.

When I attempt to do self-therapy, I count four jobs I must do simultaneously: (i) access the Self-energy to hold a therapeutic field; (ii) stay in relationship with the target part; (iii) adhere to the relevant IFS protocol, such as the 6 Fs; and (iv) note any insights gleaned from the session. 

Historically, I've found this very difficult to do on my own. I seem not to be alone – Bonnie Weiss published a companion workbook to *Self-Therapy*{{< sidenote >}}Bonnie Weiss, [Self-Therapy Workbook: An Exercise Book For The IFS Process](https://amzn.to/45z34IK) (2013).{{< /sidenote >}}, containing 32 exercises to scaffold solo sessions. Additionally, there are Facebook groups like "Parts Work Practice" and "IFS Self-Healers Community (Internal Family Systems)" with thousands of members who meet online to practice together.

But while working with a partner or a worksheet can help ease the cognitive load of an IFS session, neither of them adequately solves the problem. Working with a partner reintroduces some of the resource challenges that self-therapy seeks to alleviate. You need to find someone you trust, someone with skill, and hardest of all, someone who's available when you need them. Even if you find this person, they are unlikely to transcribe anything on your behalf, and so you'll need to go back and listen to the recording if you want to take notes. Following a worksheet presents its own limitations. {{< marginnote >}}![Papers Please](/papers-please.png) [*Papers, Please*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/239030/Papers_Please/) is a 2013 immigration officer simulator. The player must carefully interrogate would-be immigrants in order to satisfy increasingly complex and oppressive policies laid out by the (fictional) totalitarian government. Self-therapy should not feel like that.{{< /marginnote >}}Personally, I find that worksheets are contraindicated with emotional depth. Filling out a form about a part brings to mind interrogation, not intimacy. Beyond my personal qualms, static worksheets simply aren't up for the job of capturing dynamic relationships. In IFS, we learn new information about our parts all the time; we don't want to go back and update old worksheets. We want to move quickly between parts, or work on two at once; worksheets are strictly one-at-a-time. We care deeply about the connections between parts – who protects who, who is polarized with who, who fears who – worksheets don't have a way to formalize connections.

The ability to do inner work on one's own is an essential part of the IFS model. In the foreword to *Self-Therapy*, Richard Schwartz writes:

>My twenty-seven years of experience using this model... tell me that many people can do a great deal of work on themselves without a therapist. They may not be able to unburden all their exiles, but they can reverse the atmosphere of their inner worlds from one of self-loathing to self-love and Self-leadership. Also, people who are in therapy will find the book a useful guide for their between-session work on themselves. Therapy is too expensive in both time and money for many people. I’m grateful that this book allows IFS to extend its reach to those who would not otherwise have access to it.

Yet, as we've seen, there are significant barriers to conducting an effective self-therapy session. This underscores the need for innovative tools that can create strong containers for individual practice.

### Your AI therapist will see you now
Meanwhile, the arrival of breakthrough AI technologies has impacted every field, including mental health. In an ebullient essay the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen writes that soon,{{< sidenote >}}Marc Andreessen, [Why AI Will Save the World](/https://a16z.com/2023/06/06/ai-will-save-the-world/) (2023).{{< /sidenote >}}

>Every person will have an AI assistant/coach/mentor/ trainer/advisor/therapist that is infinitely patient, infinitely compassionate, infinitely knowledgeable, and infinitely helpful. The AI assistant will be present through all of life’s opportunities and challenges, maximizing every person’s outcomes.

Some of this optimism has already borne out. In a *New Yorker* profile, a hospice nurse named Maria describes how she benefited from chatting with Woebot, a mental health support chatbot:{{< sidenote >}}Dhruv Khullar, [Can AI Treat Mental Illness?](/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/03/06/can-ai-treat-mental-illness) for *The New Yorker* (2023).{{< /sidenote >}}

> Ahead of another patient visit, Maria recalled, “I just felt that something really bad was going to happen.” She texted Woebot, which explained the concept of catastrophic thinking. It can be useful to prepare for the worst, Woebot said—but that preparation can go too far. “It helped me name this thing that I do all the time,” Maria said.

Koko, an automated mental health support platform, ran a trial in which messages were composed by GPT-3 (and supervised by humans). Those messages were rated significantly higher than those written by humans on their own, and response times went down 50%.{{< sidenote >}}Rob Morris's [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RobertRMorris/status/1611450210915434499) account (2023).{{< /sidenote >}}

Even so, Koko CEO Rob Morris pulled the feature. “Once people learned the messages were co-created by a machine, it didn’t work. Simulated empathy feels weird, empty.”

Artificial empathy is worthy of research. Millions of people have no one they can talk to about their problems. Millions of people have never received compassion from another human being. For these people, having access to an AI assistant that can perform care for them may be an important contributor to their mental wellbeing. In a conversation with Tristan Harris,{{< sidenote >}}[Esther Perel on Artificial Intimacy](/your-undivided-attention-esther-perel-transcript.pdf), from the Your Undivided Attention podcast (2023).{{< /sidenote >}} Esther Perel compares these bots to imaginary friends, "transitional objects that gradually allow us to learn the ins and outs of having real relationships."

At best, these interactions with therapy chatbots afford "a temporary developmental container" that lets us rehearse for relationships with real people. At worst, they can erode our capacity to deal with the messiness of reality, and confuse us into making technology responsible for our own wellbeing.

Thankfully, IFS is unambiguously opposed to transitional objects. Even when working with a therapist, it is not the therapist's job to offer healing, insight, or even sympathy; their work is always in service of fostering the client's ability to access their own Self-energy so that the client's Self can heal the client's parts. Any AI-assisted practice environment for IFS must follow suit.

### Enter the superprompt

Earlier, I described four simultaneous jobs one must do in IFS-informed self-therapy: (i) access the Self-energy to hold a therapeutic field; (ii) stay in relationship with the target part; (iii) adhere to the 6 Fs; and (iv) note any insights gleaned from the session. Because IFS is so well-structured, it seemed possible that an AI-assisted practice environment could take over (iii) and (iv) entirely, while supporting individuals with (i) and (ii).

Using the ChatGPT API, I prototyped a system that helps me follow this protocol without needing to think about it. The system uses Whisper, an open-source audio transcription tool, which allows me to talk rather than type and keep my eyes closed – my preferred way of doing inner work. I added constraints to the system to prevent it from acting with agency, forbidding unsolicited feedback and empathy, while promoting terse, information-dense responses that reflected what it was hearing me say. This helps me safeguard my agency, and remember that I am the only Self in the session. Finally, I created a relational database that codifies my meandering, unstructured musings into well-structured data that persisted across sessions, helping me deepen my relationship to my parts over time.

{TODO PUT IN SCREENSHOT OF INTERFACE}

Incredibly, all these behaviors are defined not through code but through natural language instructions called a system prompt. System prompts are special messages used to direct the behavior of ChatGPT. 

This is the system prompt that I am currently using, after several rounds of iteration. Anyone should be able to copy and paste this into the publicly available ChatGPT interface to try augmented self-therapy out for themselves. I am using GPT-4, which is a paid offering. The only piece of the prompt that will not work is the structured data, labeled *parts_json* below. The system prompt is lightly edited for readability.

{{< figure
  src="/superprompt.png"

  caption="The system prompt that powers the practice environment. To copy and refine the system prompt for your own purposes, refer to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nsbarr/self-therapy)."
  alt=""
>}}

To be clear, though the system prompt reads like a set of instructions, the system itself doesn't have concepts like rulesets or symbolic logic. For any given sequence of words – whether it's a system prompt or input from the user – LLMs like ChatGPT "simply" predict the next word. I put "simply" in quotes because this prediction involves many thousands of operations in a many-thousand dimensional vector space. Nobody programmed these operations; instead, they emerged from training neural networks on billions of web pages. In this way, LLMs appear simultaneously simple and inscrutable, dumb and eerily smart. The implications of all this are the subject of intense debate and research.{{< sidenote >}}Timothy B Lee and Sean Trott have the [best accessible primer](https://www.understandingai.org/p/large-language-models-explained-with) I've seen on LLMs.{{< /sidenote >}}

Putting aside philosophical and existential concerns for the moment, I am astonished at how well the system adheres to these instructions, and how wonderfully it enhances my inner work. To see it in action, we will look at the transcripts of three self-therapy sessions I conducted. My comments are in italics.  

### Session 1: Getting to know a Protector

*In the following session, I came with the intention to work with some fear I was experiencing around a work situation. In IFS this is called a trailhead – a place to start getting to know a part.*

**Nick:** Yeah, so I'm feeling a lot of fear actually in the moment, a lot of anxiety in my chest region, shortness of breath. And I think it's related to some work stuff that's coming up around the corner. And I'd like to get to know that fear better today. It feels kind of like animal terror. It feels very primal.

**System:** Understood. Is the part you are describing a new part, or is it one of the existing parts: Sad Shadow, Little Boy, Angry Pusher, or Confused Part?

*The system keeps a record of all parts that Nick has worked with. At the beginning of a session, it confirms whether the target part for the session is a new part or one that Nick has worked with before.*

**N:** This is a new part, I wanna call it primal fear. And it's a feeling of anxiety in my chest, shortness of breath. It almost feels like there's like a little furry animal that's scared and I want to get to know it better.

**S:** Acknowledged. Let's continue gathering information about Primal Fear. Can you describe what it says or communicates to you?

*Because Nick has already found a part and focused on it, the system nudges him to continue with the 3rd F: fleshing the part out.*

**N:** Maybe it's clutching something like an acorn and it's like, I won't let you take this away from me or don't take this away from me or please don't take this away from me. It's sort of, it has so little and it's sort of desperately clinging on. But I guess it's also sort of confused, like maybe deep down, it's not sure if it deserves its little acorn either. I don't know, maybe I'm drifting a little bit.

**S:** Understood. So far, we have the following information about Primal Fear. 1. Name: Primal Fear 2. Emotional Feeling: Fear, anxiety 3. Appearance: A little furry animal clutching an acorn 4. Bodily Sensation: Anxiety in chest, shortness of breath 5. Speech: "Don't take this away from me." Now, how do you feel toward this part right now?

*The system reflects back what Nick currently understands about the part, and asks the 4th F: How do you feel toward the part, in order to check for Nick’s Self-energy.* 

**N:** I'm reconnecting with self-energy and just extending care toward it. Letting it know that I'm here. And that it's not alone. It doesn't have to be the only one who's fighting. It's small. It needs protection. And yeah, so I feel care for it. And I think it can feel that. It's very prominent right now. And I wanna help it more by creating like a little bit of space. So I'm asking for that space now in whatever way this part feels comfortable giving in. Showing it that we don't even have to share this video if it doesn't want to, you know, like this is. This time is about this part. Yeah, so I think it's hearing that. And I'm feeling calm, caring toward it.

**S:** Acknowledged. As you are in Self and feeling calm and caring, let's proceed to Section 2 to learn more about Primal Fear. What job is it doing for you?

*If Nick showed more reactivity or judgment toward the target part, the system would have asked Nick to unblend from his part before carrying on.*

**N:** So first of all, it's not, I don't want to call it primal fear so much because it's more than that. It's like my furry friend, I think is its name. It's a very sweet part. It has hopes and dreams, but they're very fragile. So right now I'm just checking in if there's actually two parts here. Who has the hopes and dreams and who is scared of losing them? I think this squirrel's job or this furry friend's job is not to have the hopes and dreams but to sort of like hide them and hoard them and protect them. So its job is to sort of scurry and to protect me from disappointment by not letting my hopes and dreams be so out in the open.

**S:** Acknowledged. The part's job is to hide, hoard, and protect your hopes and dreams to prevent disappointment. Next, what does the Furry Friend part fear would happen, if it did not do its job?

*With more Self-energy, Nick has a deeper understanding of the part and wants to give it a new name. The system picks this up seamlessly and starts referring to the target part as Furry Friend. It continues to ask probing questions to help Nick build his relationship with the part.*

**N:** Yeah, that my hopes and dreams would be destroyed, and that I would be destroyed. And that fear makes me feel very small, very young, very tender, very vulnerable.

**S:** Understood. The Furry Friend part fears that not doing its job would result in your hopes and dreams, and potentially you, being destroyed. What belief does this part hold?

**N:** Well, I'm hearing a few beliefs. One belief is that I am my hopes and dreams, right? Like, what am I other than my aspirations? Also, that my aspirations are very fragile, like all it takes is one person to destroy them. And this part doesn't doesn't feel like there's anyone there to protect. Like, there's something so unjust about this vulnerability.

**S:** Received. The part believes that you are defined by your aspirations, that these aspirations are fragile and can be easily destroyed, and that there is no one else to protect them, which it finds unfair. Does the Furry Friend part have a secret wish?

**N:** Secret wish, yeah. It'd be so nice if it had a champion for its hopes and dreams. It didn't have to be so squirrelly and there was a big bear friend next to it that was like, I'll fight for these hopes and dreams and I'm a big scary bear and it's going to take a lot to defeat me. We're not going to be so easily defeated. And so then the squirrel could kind of relax a bit. And the squirrel's very fast and it jumps to decisions. So it has this, it has this alacrity, it has this like energy to it. And it would be really nice if it could be more energetic and carefree and less like squirrelly, you know, less like sort of like scurrying here and there in the darkness or in fear. So that's its wish.

**S:** Received. The Furry Friend's secret wish is for a champion, a protector for its hopes and dreams, so it could relax, be more energetic and carefree rather than anxious and fear-driven. It wishes for a stronger assurance that it will not be easily defeated.

*The system has gathered all the information it needs for the session, so now it simply reflects back what it’s hearing.*

**N:** Yeah, that's right. And I'd like to end this session, but just make sure enough of the information is there. And before we end the session, I also just want to acknowledge this part for the work that it does and also acknowledge that there's more to learn about who's holding these wishes, these dreams. So I'd like to just make a note of that for next time. And maybe to some extent, the squirrel is protecting that little boy who has all these dreams and wishes and is very tender. So I get the sense that as we engage with the furry friend today, that there was simultaneously a protector and an exile. I could feel the vulnerability, but I could also feel this scurrying on top of that vulnerability. So I get the sense that this furry friend is a protector. And so I just want to thank it for the work it does and make a commitment to continue this work and understand all the parts that are involved.

*Nick acknowledges the part and makes a commitment to do more work, which is a common practice in IFS.*

**S:** Acknowledged. I have stored that information. The Furry Friend, while holding a protective role, is also associated with an underlying vulnerability that might be linked to the Little Boy part. There is more to explore about this dynamic in future sessions. Here is the updated information about all the parts:

```json
{
    "name": "Furry Friend",
    "emotional_feeling": "Fear, anxiety",
    "appearance": "A little furry animal clutching an acorn",
    "bodily_sensation": {
        "feeling": "Anxiety in chest, shortness of breath"
    },
    "speech": "Don't take this away from me.",
    "job": "Hide, hoard, and protect hopes and dreams to prevent disappointment",
    "fear": "Hopes and dreams, and potentially you, will be destroyed",
    "belief": "You are defined by your aspirations and these can be easily destroyed",
    "wish": "For a champion, a protector for its hopes and dreams, so it can relax and be less fear-driven"
}
```

*Nick decides to end the session. The system generates structured data that summarizes the essential qualities of the part. This data is saved across sessions, so in a future session Nick can do further work on this part, or learn how it relates to other parts.*

### Session 2: Deepening a relationship with an Exile
{TODO: NEED TO FIND SOMETHING LESS VULNERABLE / MAYBE USE SOMEONE ELSE}


### Generating a parts map with Midjourney
<!--{{< marginnote ind="⊕" >}}<span id="activation">![Activation](/activation.png) Activating a Part in Order to Access It, from *Self-Therapy*</span>{{< /marginnote >}}-->

*Self-Therapy* makes wonderful use of illustrations, drawn by Karen Donnelly.{{< marginnote ind="⊕" >}}<span id="sandy">![Sandy](/sandy.png)Sandy's Pyche, from *Self-Therapy*</span>{{< /marginnote >}} They helped me understand some of the key concepts of the IFS model. They also pointed out the imaginal nature of parts work – we come to understand our parts not intellectually so much as by actually seeing them and taking them in.

I myself have a very limited visual imagination - it’s hard for me to picture anything in my mind's eye. I’m also not a particularly enthusiastic drawer. So I turned to Midjourney, an AI-powered image generation tool, to illustrate my inner world. As with ChatGPT, the prompt plays a crucial role in Midjourney; to find an evocative style inspired by the book, I landed on this:

> black and white pencil sketch of {part description}, dreamlike illustration, harsh realism, storybook illustration, emphasizes emotion over realism, nightmare, detailed sketches

That produced helpful illustrations for parts like Young Dreamer, Furry Friend, Dark Blanket, and Clenched Fist, seen here:

{{< figure

  alt="Two images side-by-side. In the first, Self energy, represented by a heart, is covered by various Protectors, while the Exiles are hidden behind a curtain. In the second, Self energy is now uncovered, and all parts are cooperating. Exiles are no longer behind the curtain."
>}}

From here, I arranged my parts into a relational map. The parts map is a popular tool among IFS practitioners. In the *Self-Therapy Workbook*, Bonnie Weiss writes:

>Many people find it very helpful to map their parts. Mapping can clarify relationships between parts, flesh out the number of parts at a trailhead, illuminate the protective system, illustrate which parts are central to the system and which are peripheral, show where parts stand in terms of their relationship to the Self, and much more.

>Mapping can be done when you are just beginning to get to know your system. You can check in periodically with the original map to see how things have changed as you keep working. You can also use parts mapping as an ongoing tool for visually tracking your internal work and deciding where to focus your attention.

>There are many ways to map your system. One way is to use a large sheet of paper and write down the names or images of the parts as you know them. You can draw lines or arrows to illustrate the relationships. 

Here, the benefit of structured data over static worksheets becomes apparent. With a little engineering effort, the practice environment could automatically generate a parts map from the data, illustrating parts and their relationships on a canvas. This would provide individuals with a synoptic view of their inner system, along with the ability to dive into individual parts. 

{{< figure
  src="/parts-card.jpg"

  alt="Two images side-by-side. In the first, Self energy, represented by a heart, is covered by various Protectors, while the Exiles are hidden behind a curtain. In the second, Self energy is now uncovered, and all parts are cooperating. Exiles are no longer behind the curtain."

>}}

As shown above, the parts map itself could nudge the individual to revisit Exiles that haven't been worked on for some time, or to explore the relationship between Protectors that might not know about each other yet. 

For now, I maintain my parts map in the design tool Figma, separate from the practice environment.  

### Benefits of the practice environment

Enables a deep, consistent practice 
- talking out loud actually helps (rubber ducking)
- active listening helps
- 20m multiple times a week

Intelligence across sessions
- advantage over the GPT interface
- rewards longer-term practice

Shared representations of data
- multiple representations, like parts map
- cite paper

Structured but fluid
- switching parts
- completing things out of order
- going on tangents
- renaming parts

### Limitations to a digital practice partner

From the start, I set out to create an AI system that would not attempt to perform the trademark "8 Cs" of Self-energy: compassion, creativity, curiosity, confidence, courage, calm, connectedness, and clarity. In fact, as the system prompt shows, I explicitly instructed it not to perform empathetic speech, and instead focus on efficiency and accurate synthesis.  As a result, the practice environment breaks down in situations that require more Self-energy than the individual currently has available.

These situations fall into two categories, on opposite sides of a spectrum of depth. On the shallow side, the practice environment is not suited for beginners to IFS specifically, and to the concept of parts generally. It takes training and potentially a guide to take the first step of noticing that our mind consists of subpersonalities, and that these subpersonalities have beliefs, hopes, and fears that are important for us to receive. On the deep side, the practice environment is not suited for the deepest healing of exiles, in which another person's healing energy can be indispensable.

Consider this snippet of work that Dick Schwartz did with a long-time client, a Vietnam war veteran who had severe anger issues. At this moment, the client is approaching a group of shadowy spirits surrounding the body of his deceased brother: 

Schwartz: Tell them it’s you appreciate them carrying all that stuff and we really want to help them with it. 
Client: They’re saying it’s about time, we’re tired. 
S: Yeah, it is. Are they still bouncing around? 
C: Almost seems like they stopped to take notice. 
S: Can you count how many of them there are? more than 10? 
C: Absolutely.
S: Reassure them we’re here to help them. We may not be able to help them all today, but we do what to help
them all. How are they reacting? 
C: Very interested
S: Probably best to go one at a time or all of them who are connected to a certain scene in the past. Is that ok?
They can talk about it and decide who can go first. One or a group. 
C: There's a group centered around my brother
S: How are you feeling toward them? 
C: I just want to talk to them. 
S: Good. Is it okay if just that group comes out of the room and comes closer to you? 
C: Yes. 
S: Lets bring out that group connected to your brother. 
C: It’s like there’s one senior and numerous younger, smaller ones.
S: Are you feeling some caring for these guys? 
C: Yeah. 
S: Let them know you really care about them and keep doing that til they start to trust us.
(silence) How’s it going? Do they trust? 
C: Yeah. 
S: So would you be up for looking at what they need you to see about your
brother? 
C: Yes. 
S: Ask them to not totally overwhelm you with feelings, so you can be with them.
C: When they brought my brother back I was at Pendleton. They flew me back to Illinois for 3 days I stood at the head of
his casket in my dress blues and I didn’t move. For years I was a marine and not a brother or son. I wasn’t much
help to my parents. I'm sorry for that. Now it’s too late. At the cemetery when they played taps, I cried so hard
inside that no tears came out. Going back to the house. My grandmother said. I wonder if he felt any pain. I remember
my mother screaming. All I wanted to do was rip my uniform off and run.
S: I'd like you to enter that scene with that young man and be there for him. What ever he heeds, just be there
with him. Can you do that? 
C: Yeah. He needs to cry. 
S: Can you help him see it’s safe to cry? 
C: I have to take him out of the uniform. 
S: Great. Do that. 
C: (sobs) Yeah. It’s almost like there’s a light. 
S: Yeah, that’s right. 
C: Even though the pain is tremendous, there’s a brighter point later. 
S: That’s right. You’re doing great. 
C: Down on his knees, doubled up. 
S: That’s great. You be with him. 
C: I’m holding him telling him it’s okay. 

Schwartz's quality of compassion, of being there, would be difficult to effectively formalize into a system prompt. 

Between these bookends of depth, the practice environment works better. Initial user testing with 4 volunteers suggest a kind of bell curve of utility:

### Limitations to the conversational medium 

Why did ChatGPT explode in popularity? One reason was the launch of GPT 3.5, which was a significant improvement over GPT 3. But another reason was that OpenAI made a massive design change. Previous versions of GPT were built around the paradigm of autocomplete; a user could write any text, and the interface would “complete” the text – continue some dialog, finish writing an essay, or carry out the rest of a task. With ChatGPT, OpenAI rolled out a simple chat interface. Under the hood, things were the same. But the experience users had was now one of a conversation; a back-and-forth with someone, or something, on the other side.

We humans are irresistibly drawn to conversation. As IFS reveals, we don’t merely engage in external dialog with friends, family, and colleagues. Our interior worlds are also profoundly conversational, with subpersonalities engaging in relentless and often combative internal dialog. So, part of ChatGPT’s popularity derived from its ability to tap into our innate predisposition for conversation. For systems using the OpenAI API, the temptation to build a chat interface is twofold: first, because of the familiarity and affinity users have for chatting, and second, because it is the easiest and most natural way to work with the technology. 

But when it comes to inner work, the conversational medium has several drawbacks that have emerged in user testing:

* Interruptive. The system only supports voice input. I made this design choice because I process my feelings verbally, and I knew that I would be able to stay connected with the work better if I was speaking rather than writing. Even so, the system involves several interruptive elements. First, unlike a natural conversation, the user must decide when to click Record, and when to click Send. As one tester said, “I’m noticing some friction with the Record button.” When the user does click Send, it can take up to a minute for the system to transcribe their speech and generate a response. Because I’m familiar with the system, I use that time to continue the inner work. But for testers, it was more intuitive to just look at the screen and patiently wait. To improve this process, we would want more of a streaming experience, in which the whole session is recorded, and the system just knows when to chime in with reflection or guidance. Currently, such an experience would be technically difficult to accomplish, because of cost and speed restrictions. But “streaming intelligence” is likely around the corner. 
* Directive. When someone asks you a question, you answer it. In this way, questions are actually a kind of implicit command. As a result, any question that the system acts, no matter how helpful it’s intended, constitutes a request of the user. Consider this exchange that a tester – we’ll call him Jason – had with the interface during his initial session:Jason: Okay, here we go. Start talking to begin my session. Yes, I guess I would treat this as a normal session. I suppose I had actually just finished one of my Gestalt therapy sessions and I feel a desire to process some stuff around my partner and I feel quite conflicted in whether I am clinging on to a relationship that perhaps is not actually there. Yeah, so let’s see where that gets me.System: To begin, please describe a part related to your feelings about your relationship. Include the part’s appearance, emotional feeling, how it feels in your body and where, what it says and its desire or goal.Jason immediately recognized this as a poor response. “My therapist lens already comes on. It's like, wow, this is a lot to go into very fast.” To be sure, tactical changes to the system prompt can help here; for example, the system could be instructed to “Only ask one or two questions at a time,” or “Give one or two next steps, in the form of ‘Possible places to explore are the x, or y.”But these are just band-aids on a deeper drawback to the conversational medium, which is that it is a “single-thread” interface; it doesn’t afford unobtrusive interventions like hints, recommendations, ideas, or guesses. Jeffrey Heer calls such nudges “a ‘search frontier’ sensitive to a user’s current focus and goals, with automated support parameterized by observations of user behavior.“
* Deceptive.

### The IKEA effect and other caveats
I built this system for myself. I've tuned it to my own preferences over the course of several sessions, such that it now suits me quite well. 

But I’ve had enough success using it that I do wonder if it would be helpful to others practicing self-therapy in the IFS model.

Many thousands of people do this: the “IFS Self-Healers Community” Facebook Group has more than 5,000 members; “IFS Parts Art” has more than 7,000. Perhaps many more people would practice self-therapy if they had tools that supported their practice and made it more feasible.

### Questing for coziness
I have the following hesitations about pursuing the idea any further by building a shareable prototype: caring for the security of highly sensitive information; finding a price point that covers the costs of maintaining the service; needing to explain to others how AI is used and how it isn’t; appearing to be an AI advocate.

Most notably, a sufficiently motivated individual can do almost everything I’ve accomplished here in a few hours work, especially if they use the system prompts I’ve provided as a starting point. 

For that reason, I’ve chosen to document the entire process as thoroughly as I can, with the hopes that this work may inform those interested in practicing or building in the AI-supported mental health space.

Should anyone try this out themselves, they may find two significant challenges using ChatGPT:

- **Data storage**. Data storage is managed entirely by ChatGPT, meaning that the integrity of the data rests precariously on the correct interpretation of the system prompt. I imagine a mature product would have some data validation built in to ensure that ChatGPT follows the intended format.
- **Removing agency**. OpenAI has given ChatGPT a generic personality: chipper, eager to help, cautious around sensitive subjects. I had limited success overwriting these out-of-the-box traits to create a terse, almost robotic copilot. Occasionally, default ChatGPT will chime in with something like “I'm really sorry that you're feeling this way, but I'm unable to assist. It's really important to talk things over with someone who can, though, such as a mental health professional.” This is always unwelcome and disruptive to the work.

The conversational paradigm is a very powerful one, but by no means the only option that would have worked here. One could imagine, for example, a “smart worksheet” filling out itself as the individual speaks, with no conversational interface at all.

Midjourney and the parts map are all done manually right now; as of writing Midjourney doesn’t offer an API, so an automatically generated parts map would need to use another image-generating service.

Midjourney feels like a weak link, for reasons beyond its technical limitations. I just don’t know if it contributes to my wellbeing. To be sure, it’s *fun –* it makes the whole system more vivid, more memorable, more gamelike. Squint at the parts map and maybe you can see the “Harvest Moon for therapy” idea. But I do wonder if I’m missing something by not drawing parts myself – the  field of art therapy is not one I’m familiar with. (Of course, it’s not either/or: a mature product could populate parts with default illustrations and encourage the individual to add their own.)
