Maybe you have woken up to your present situation. It can also show how you are emerging from a period of withdrawal. Sometimes you wake because someone is calling you or you feel threatened. It is important with such dreams to capture the feeling and see if you have felt that before in the past, or who is calling you and why.</p><p>Sometimes an awakening happens to mark a future inner growth was taking place. Or you realise as the example that you have ‘been asleep’ to much that you were capable of experiencing and now are awake to it. We can also realise that something has either be repressed since youth, or ha been held back from being expressed because you were involved in dealing with other things snd you have awoken things that you had wanted to do or develop such as art, writing, starting a business or even in the sense of a desires for love and a willingness to face sexual experience, and give oneself to it.</p><p>To become aware of something. Not able to let go of conscious thoughts and involvements.</p><p>Example: I was suddenly awakened by a feeling I was being attacked. Still dreaming I looked to my right and saw a strange man standing near my bed who I felt was trying to mess with my head. Reaching out I send a bolt of energy at him that exploded in his face. He immediately disappeared, but I sent several other bolts exploding after him. This amazed me because I had never done anything like that before.</p><p>Example: I know that she has had no sexual life for 20 years, and I have now awoken her passions again. She takes me to an upstairs room, and I believe her husband comes back, but she gets rid of him somehow, I think for good.</p><p><u>Idioms</u>: Rude awakening; wake up to something; wide awake.</p><p><strong>Useful questions are:</strong></p><p>What woke me or involved my interest?</p><p>Is there something I am frightened of that keeps me from sleeping?</p><p>Have I got a habit of not sleeping?</p></div><div class='entry'><h2>Aversion</h2><p>The dream and its symbols need to be considered to see what the aversion is referring to. What one tries to avoid may be clearly shown in the dream, such as avoiding sex, social contact, or expressing ones power. If it isn’t, look for clues in the events, people or objects of the dream. Often, what we avoid has some difficult feelings attached to it that if dealt with will remove the aversion. One of the most direct ways of meeting an aversion is to gradually confront what is obnoxious until either the feelings underlying it are exposed and released, or the aversion disappears.

Autumn in your dream may also suggest a time which is not good for active creativity, but more suited to ‘being’ rather than ‘doing’. The falling leaves of autumn may therefore remind you that many attitudes are outworn – no longer necessary ways of living and working – are falling away and not to be held on to.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Autumn leaves</strong>:</span> Old memories, skills, attitudes, things you have developed in life that are no longer performing a useful function due to the changes happening.

It may be a time to rest and let go some of the outer activities of the past.</p><p>Mrs C. had the following dream at a time when she started her own business against her husband’s wishes, and one week before he walked out on her. Autumn here depicts the sense of something coming to an end.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p>Example: ‘ My husband was in a wheelchair, I was pushing him along a promenade. At the end of the promenade was a path which we took. The path went along the top of a cliff. The sea below was pretty rough, a typical Autumn day at the seaside. All of a sudden the path came to an end and there was a steep slope to the right which led down to the beach, I decided to turn right and go down the slope. When we got half way down the slope the path started to give way on the left and I found myself without enough room for the four wheels of the wheelchair. I was desperately holding on, tilting the wheelchair to the right to keep it balanced on the two right wheels when my husband got panicky in the chair and moved. The chair tilted to the left and fell down the rocks. I started running down the path towards the beach, towards my husband and the wheelchair. I never reached the wheelchair or my husband because I awoke and that was the end of the dream. ‘ Mrs C.</p><p>Example: My brother had his arm around my shoulder as we looked at the dark blue night sky. A symbol like a witch appeared in the sky. I looked at a tree with no leaves, just three branches. A cat and dog sat on it. The cat was on a branch that veered outwards. The branch broke off and my brother said, ‘Is that the way it’s going to be?’ Kelly 19</p><p><em> </em></p><p>This fascinating dream by a young woman of 19 most likely depicts her relationship with her brother. The lack of leaves shows there is nothing now growing between them. The dog and projecting branch represent him, and the cat herself. There is I believe a fairly obvious sexual connection, and the dream shows how she is breaking away from an unconscious male female link with her brother as she matures. The branches come from the same trunk depicting family relationship.</p><p><em>Useful Questions and Hints:</em></p><p>What is the autumn of my dream offering or revealing?</p><p>Is this autumn a time of loss or of fresh opportunity?</p><p>What are the fruits of my summer that exist in this autumn?</p><p>See <strong><a href="http://dreamhawk.com/dream-encyclopedia/identity-and-dreams/">Identity and Dreams</a>; <a href="http://dreamhawk.com/dream-encyclopedia/plot-of-the-dream/">Plot of the Dream</a>; <a href="http://dreamhawk.com/dream-encyclopedia/individuation/">Individuation</a>.</strong></p></div><div class='entry'><h2>Autopsy</h2><p>A search within oneself or ones life experiences for what has caused something in you to die or to stop functioning.</p><p>You could be asking yourself questions, and so examining the past for clues – perhaps for what has brought about present loss of motivation or sense of loss.</p><p><em>Useful Questions and Hints:</em></p><p>What am I examining in myself or another?</p><p>Am I tearing myself open about some issue, or being torn open trying to understand it?</p><p>Can I bury this body now it has been examined?</p><p>Try <strong><a href="http://dreamhawk.com/dream-dictionary/practical-techniques-for-understanding-your-dreams/#TalkingAs">Talking As</a> </strong>the body being examined, or <strong><a href="file:///C:/Library/aaa/Ebook%20Publishing/Dream%20Dictionary%20Ultimate-Kindle.DOC#Body">body</a></strong>.<strong></strong></p></div><div class='entry'><h2>Automobile</h2><p>See: <a href="http://dreamhawk.com/dream-dictionary/car/"><strong>Car</strong></a>, or parts of car, such as engine, etc.</p></div><div class='entry'><h2>Automaton</h2><p>A habitual and unthinking or unconscious reaction; some aspect of the body’s automatic working, or a view of the body as mechanical instead of alive and intelligent.

We know now that our eyesight is only aware of a tiny part of the spectrum of light, our hearing only aware of a small amount that dogs and bats can hear, and the radiations from our brain also are unknown to us except if we use special equipment. And all of those radiations are seen as an aura reaching out from our body and can sometimes be seen as colours or what we call an aura.</p><p>I know many people say there is no such thing as an aura. But now people are often shown wearing night or infrared glasses. These enable our poor eyesight to extend its range slightly, so the can see the aura of heat that surrounds living bodies.</p><p>Another explanation is that people who have a very intense experience of illumination or enlightenment sometimes are seen with an aura.</p><p>Sometimes we touch a concept or feeling that has massive connections, so vast they begin to build up beyond usual levels of realisation or sensing. We might call it a mega-concept, which goes on building and generating realisations we have never had before – that is, we have never made those connections before. When your mind is functioning in that way you become a different type of human being, an individual, but connected much more fully with your inner and outer reality.</p><p>So an aura around an object, person or animal depicts this function, i.e. that in the dream you are aware of more than you usually are, or more of your potential is being expressed. As such the aura show how much of your potential is shining out of you. The first example below illustrates this. See: <strong><a href="http://dreamhawk.com/dream-encyclopedia/the-archetype-of-the-self/">archetype of the self</a>.</strong></p><p>The aura in dreams is also often associated with death, or the spirit of the person whose aura is seen – spirit being here used in the same way as ‘she had a fighting spirit’. Therefore it might suggest we are aware of wondrous or awful qualities of soul of the person or ourselves. It can also suggest power of some sort – internal energy.</p><p>Seeing an aura can link with intuitions or feelings you have about the person you see it around. Occasionally the aura indicates a health problem. In such cases the dream would include some feeling or realisation that the colours or marks in the aura showed an illness or upset in the system.</p><p>Example: I was following a woman up a hill. As I did this I experienced a very wonderful feeling. It felt as if light were beginning to shine out of me as if I had a glowing aura. When we reached the top of the hill we were arms about each other, and I had the glorious sense of being wholly myself – wholly a man. I sensed that I had reached a new level of manhood by more fully accepting myself, by more fully giving and allowing more of myself to be available to others. It felt to me as if manhood is a glory, a shining out of life itself through a particular person.</p><p>Example: When we came to my sister, I had the feeling she was ill. I can’t fathom why, but I was just about to ask him to look after her, when he stretched out his right hand and gently stroked her cheek. He said to her, “You’re dead aren’t you?” I was absolutely stunned and it was then that I was aware of how cold and white he was. I realised then that he was dead, and so he could see she was dying – due to some aura as her spirit was leaving her body. He then disappeared, and I was frantic trying to find him, to ask him how long before she would die. I was crying and almost hysterical to find him, and that is how I awoke. L. W.</p><p>Example I had a dream that I was talking to about 5 or 6 people and I was reading each person’s aura. Suddenly one of them came to me and asked if I could I tell him the colour of his aura. All at once I heard celestial songs and his aura was all white. I awoke feeling like the person had been Jesus. As a result of this dream, I had a pain in my head for several days afterward. <strong><a href="http://www.edgarcayce.org/">ARE</a> </strong>dream.</p><p>The last example is interesting because the woman dreamer begins to experience something beyond her usual awareness. The pain in the head is a common result of this as parts of the brain that were dormant or inactive begin to operate or develop.</p><p>Example: ‘I walked past a married couple who were walking up the hill too. As I passed I heard them say something about a shepherd. Looking up the hill I saw the sheep, then The Shepherd. A beautiful aura of many colours surrounded The Shepherd. I looked and felt joy and exuberance rise in me, and I ran to the couple saying it was THE SHEPHERD.’ Brian C.</p><p><em>Useful Questions and Hints:</em></p><p>What am I feeling or realising about the aura?</p><p>Does this extend my awareness of something or someone?</p><p>If I imagine myself as that aura what do I feel?</p><p>See <strong><a href="file:///C:/Library/aaa/Ebook%20Publishing/-%20http:/dreamhawk.com/dream-encyclopedia/altered-states-of-consciousness/#ASC">Altered State of Consciousness</a></strong> – <a href="http://dreamhawk.com/dream-encyclopedia/what-we-need-to-remember-about-dreaming/#Virtual"><strong>Dreams are Virtual Realities</strong></a><strong> – <a href="http://dreamhawk.com/inner-life/what-is-the-experience-of-enlightenment-like/">Enlightenment</a>.</strong></p></div><div class='entry'><h2>Aunt</h2><p>To some extent an aunt is a role model. We gather from their success or failure strategies for our own life. Whatever feelings we have about them, whatever we think of them, the dream will use this to illustrate something for you. So consider how you would describe your aunt, what sort of person she is, and how you feel about her. The dream will be using her image to illustrate the role you see her in. If she is a success, ask yourself what in yourself you are facing regarding success. If you feel she is a failure, ask yourself what of your own feelings about failure you are facing.</p><p>If she is dead and appears in your dream it can mean that she is still very active in your life as feelings and ideas.</p><p>If you are sexually attracted to her it also indicates that you see in her something you want in your life.</p><p><em>Useful Questions and Hints:</em></p><p>What is my relationship with and feelings about this aunt, and how does that relate to my life now?</p><p>What is the central theme of this dream, and what does that indicate as the feature to consider?

Or a person that you have not recognised.</p><p>The attic is often a place of exploration, and sometimes a great deal of sexual feeling is hidden in it. Sometimes if you are high up and have a great view it can represent your ability to have a much wider view of life – like cosmic consciousness.</p><p>Also in some dreams it is a very frightening experience where we meet those things we would rather not see or remember.</p><p>Example: I was sleeping in an attic. A large dog was with me – a wolfhound like I used to exercise a few years ago. I and the dog would go out together. The dog was wild and free. I enjoyed being with it. together we did things like hunting which felt very real in the sense of not being artificial behaviour. Although I never washed I felt clean and healthy. Leon.</p><p>When Leon explored his dream he felt the attic was a place where he could exist but not be involved with people. The attic reminded him of the attic in a childhood house, where his mother never went because of the steep ladder. So he could go there and be alone, free of other people’s presence and influence.</p><p>Example: Then I was walking up the several flights of stairs to get to the attic room. I was holding a small dog in my arms – one of those rather flat nosed toy dogs. I arrived at the attic I put the dog down. But now the attic was empty and dark. I could feel my hair stand on end and my skin ‘crawling’. Actually I feel it all again as I write this. The feeling arose because there was an unformed dark shape creeping around at the far end of the room. The dog was really afraid and came into my arms. Then the dark creature leapt at me, transforming into a massive mouth with huge fangs and awful demonic face. Immediately I leapt at it in the same way and smashed against its face with my own huge fangs. This utterly disarmed it because it had felt, in its primitive way, to terrify me. It surprised me too that I could so immediately transform into a monster when necessary.</p><p>Then I approached the dark form, back in its original condition, trying to find out what it was and why I had met it in that way. Gradually I experienced its situation. It had originally been a human being, but had gradually lost its humanness and become this slinking darkness. I was slowly able to help it realise that it could once more take the path to become human if it wanted to. Then it asked me how that could be done. I told it that first of all it had to come out of this dark and empty place to mix with people. The human environment created a different surrounding and influence that would penetrate it and help it to change. It also asked me how I knew about its condition and how I could transform into its own monstrous form. I told it I had once experienced that condition, and that’s how I knew it was possible to come out of it. In fact it was a reflection and dramatisation of an aspect myself</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>If trapped in an attic</strong></span>: a purely intellectual approach to life.

If it is a lecture or school, it would suggest interest in or need to attend to serious studies or thought. If it is a wedding then there is some link with relationship. Therefore consider what it might suggest or look up what was attended.</p><p><em>Useful Questions and Hints:</em></p><p>What am I feeling about this?</p><p>Are there things I need to attend to, and what does the dream suggest they are?</p><p>What is my attitude about what is happening, and how does that relate to my life?</p><p>Your body can often be a way to understand your dreams. See <strong><a href="http://dreamhawk.com/dream-encyclopedia/peer-dream-group/#usebody">Using the Body</a></strong>.</p></div><div class='entry'><h2>Attack Attacked Attacker</h2><p>In looking at many dreams in which attack takes place, it is obvious that there are many degrees and forms of attack. So attack or being attacked can represent many things such as feeling attacked or threatened by ones own impulses such as anger or sexuality; feeling surreptitiously attacked by other people and their attitude to you or their remarks; a subtle sense of being attacked by age, or a serious attack by an illness – one speaks of an asthma or virus attack for instance, but also one may be attacked by a poison, or food if one is allergic to it; one might personally attack an issue or a project, and so a dream might depict one attacking something in this sense; confidence may be attacked; it is a common term in sport or business, and so may refer to attitude or energy. This aspect of attack may also refer to ones beliefs, or to other peoples, which may be attacked and threatened; attack is also sometimes a form of defence, so may suggest defensiveness about some issue or aspect of ones life. A positive side to attack is that we often feel attacked by an emerging new insight or positive personal change. We feel it as an attack because it threatens our old way of life, our habitual way of ding things and thinking about things.</p><p>It is important to define or be aware of ones response to threat or attack in a dream. Experiments in connection with dreams in which the person runs away from attack, or is very passive, show that if the dreamer visualises changing the situation and faces attackers, their dreams and even waking behaviour changes radically. Passivity in dream situations may depict the innate feeling that we are helpless in dealing with the feelings involved. This usually dates from past experience, perhaps in childhood, where in fact one did not have the strength or maturity to meet what was happening. See <a href=" http://dreamhawk.com/dream-encyclopedia/example-15-life-changes/"><strong>Life Changes</strong></a>.</p><p>Occasionally attack in dreams shows a desire to be attacked in order to live out forms of self punishment or sadism. In most such cases this desire arises out of a need to remember, and make fully conscious, punishment or sadism that has been practised on the dreamer.</p><p><strong>Being attacked: </strong>This dream usually arises because in some way you are repressing, in conflict with, or frightened off your own emotions, sexuality or anger. Occasionally the fear is about ones own potential or expanded awareness.</p><p><strong>Attacked by animal</strong>: Feeling under threat from external events or internal emotions, impulses or ideas; feeling a victim in relationship to others and self; taking a defensive attitude. The repression or fear here is in regard to your own natural urges. Sometimes our dreams put into animal form someone who we feel is expressing anger toward us.</p><p><strong>Attacked by shadowy or frightening figure: </strong>Our childhood traumas and fears may take this guise in a dream. So in this case the attack is depicting our feelings of fear and pain surrounding those past issues. How we meet such an attack is important. If we run from it, the trauma may remain largely unconscious, and therefore capable of influencing our behaviour negatively. Better to explore it or change it. (For help doing this see <a href="http://dreamhawk.com/dream-encyclopedia/peer-dream-group/"><strong>Stand in Role under peerdream work.</strong></a>)</p><p><strong>Attacked by animal:</strong> Introverting one’s own aggression or sexuality; fear of one’s own natural urges; anxiety about aggression in oneself or other people; feeling attacked by an external person.</p><p><strong>Being the attacker:</strong> This is more positive, as you are not being passive and hurt in your dreams. But you are still in conflict with whatever it is your attacking. Considering that what you attack is probably a part of your own personality, it might be better to meet it in some way. Positive self expression; defending oneself against something one feels threatened by; attempt to destroy some urge or feeling in oneself or others. The word attack is also used in many ways, so might refer to an ‘attack’ of an illness, or ‘heart attack’. Can express the difference between feeling threatened by a work/relationship/sex problem, or feeling challenged by it in a way to stimulate creativity or research.</p><p><strong>Bird attacking:</strong> Fear of ideas, ideals or opinions; verbal attack by others; fear of the Self – a view of things that may destroy ones present more limited views or opinions.</p><p><strong>Sexual attack:</strong> This has many aspects, and can at times be a re-playing of previous sexual attacks, or an expression of fear concerning them. But we also create dreams of sexual attack when we are frightened of our own feelings and desires. Grof gives the interesting account of a woman who experienced many images of sexual attack. He says:-</p><p>…. whenever a boy friend initiated even the most innocent sexual approach, such as touching. embracing, or kissing, she was overwhelmed with terror. It seemed to her that when such a situation occurred, her lover was actually changing physically and assuming animal features. Repeatedly, she fled from these situations in a state of panic anxiety and never wanted to see her partner again. Episodes of this kind were repeatedly relived …. with details of the physical setting, as well as the physical sensations and emotions involved.

Grof. Published by Souvenir Press.</p><p><strong>Someone else being attacked:</strong> Anger or aggression toward another; killing off an aspect of oneself represented by the person in the dream. If the person is someone you are in relationship with, it suggests an attempt, however short, to distance oneself from them emotionally. See: <a href="http://dreamhawk.com/dream-dictionary/fight/"><strong>fight</strong></a>; <a href="http://dreamhawk.com/dream-dictionary/war/"><strong>War</strong></a>.</p><p>Example: I had this dream at a time when there was a lot of talk and anxiety in newspapers and on television about nuclear war. In the dream a nuclear attack had been announced. I immediately thought of my children who are away in boarding school. I go out into the street to see if I can get to them, but realise it is hopeless. In the street everybody is walking about as if it were a holiday Sunday. I realised there was no time to get to my children so decided to join the people on the street. John C.</p><p>John had this dream at a time when there was a lot of media coverage about nuclear attack. It is therefore most likely dealing with his real fears about how he would deal with such an attack if it happened.</p><p>Example: Whilst suffering from nervous exhaustion three years ago. I had a recurring nightmare that left me feeling totally worthless and wretched. In it I underwent an indecent attack upon my person by my father. I was about four or five in the dream. It was not the attack in itself that left me with these feelings, but rather the look my mother gave me shortly afterwards – making me feel like a specimen in a jar. In the dream I sensed she had refused to be his wife fully, until he had got us into our own home again. I sense she is blaming me for not being able to continue with this threat, and that once more she will have to suffer my father’s attentions because of me. There is no one to help me so I decide to leave. I pack a small case, which I believe someone gets for me. In reality I did try to leave home at this age but got no further than the bus stop across the road. Maria.</p><p>Maria gives no indication of whether she was abused by her father, but the dream is certainly dealing with the sexual politics of her parents.</p><p>Example: Several men attacked me and were trying to drag me off somewhere against my will. As the dream progressed, or replayed, I began to realise that it only appeared like an attack because I was resisting the process. In fact the men wanted to show me something that was important to me. They were being quite gentle, but because of my resistance, it felt to me like an aggressive act. My thoughts about this are that this may represent the way I feel about events. Because of underlying anxiety, I feel events and changes, such as losing my job are very threatening and difficult to bear. In fact no harm has come from these events at all. The dream suggests that I am being led somewhere if only I would go along with things. Albie R.</p><p>Sometimes it is our response to the action that makes it appear like an attack.

Usually this about fears for the future and what might develop in the external world through the immense forces of politics and national conflict. It is often coupled with the dreamer’s survival strategies. In this way the dreamer might be trying out in the dream things he or she might do in such a situation.</p><p>The atom bomb or dreaming of a mushroom cloud can also depict the end of a particular world or way of life for the dreamer; i.e. the end of school life; divorce; loss of spouse; tremendous potential energy, but related to in a way that threatens the dreamer, and is therefore not harnessed. In other words the dreamer is relating to the change as a cataclysmic and destructive one.</p><p>It can also suggest fear of the irrational forces of life and the unconscious which may destroy all we have built in our conscious self.

It has become something greater than both-a hope in the human heart! It has become a symbol, a quest, the lost continent of oneself. It is all the submerged continent of our Eternal Nature, our hidden but imperishable self. We long once more for the Garden of Eden, and mankind’s original spiritual home, where he lived at peace with our self and our surroundings, and at one with both.</p><p>In this particular sense, it matters not whether Atlantis exists as a material fact. There are signs of it here and there if we look about. Like the outer signs we see of our own spiritual nature, they are- tantalising signs promising so much more than they actually tell. They point our attention down under the waters, into the deeps of ourself, and leave us wondering how we may get beneath the surface to actually see for ourselves. Not just to guess, to feel sure because of the signs, but to know through direct contact. But your dream may give you clues how to find it.</p><p>Another recent prophet, Edgar Cayce, states the same thing -that Atlantis will rise, and the Great Temple of Poseidia will be seen again. To quote a statement he made in deep trance like sleep, “Poseidia will be among the first portions of Atlantis to rise again. Expect it in ’68 and ’69. This was said in 1940. This hasn’t happened in our outer live, but it has certainly happened in our inner world.</p></div><div class='entry'><h2>Athlete</h2><p>This is not about whether you are athletic in an external sense, but about the dedication, the strength or drive to succeed you can tap into in your everyday, or working life and your personal urge to change. A handicapped person who challenges themselves to positively meet life with a smile and vigour is as much tapping into the athlete power as an Olympic winner. This also connects with people who change the health and state of their body through continued exercise and good living.</p><p>The negative side of this is the attitude that leads a person to use their strength of body or purpose to bully, threaten or injure others. It may manifest as a form of showing off how strong, powerful or sexual you are – or at least posing as such. See<strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"> <a href="http://dreamhawk.com/dream-encyclopedia/archetype-of-the-athlete/" style="color: #0000ff;">Archetype of the Athlete</a></span>.</strong></p><p> </p><p><em>Useful Questions and Hints:</em></p><p>Does this influence enter my life in a strengthening way or as an urge to dominate or impress others?</p><p>If the athlete is acting positively in me, what particular qualities is it bringing to me and how can I enhance or continue to develop them?</p><p>It can help understanding if you <strong><a href="file:///C:/Library/aaa/Ebook%20Publishing/-%20http:/dreamhawk.com/dream-encyclopedia/peer-dream-group/#5inrole">get into role</a></strong> as the athlete.</p></div><div class='entry'><h2>Atheist</h2><p><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em;">Dreaming of an atheist or being one oneself may simple be that one does not agree with what the organised church teaches, or because the person does not believe in God.</span></p><p>But being an atheist is a form of blindness. The reason is that they are missing seeing what the roots of religion are. The roots are not about worshipping an external and all powerful deity. There is a much more direct and personal reason.</p><p>Take for instance your own existence and your origins and continued existence. Can you see that you are a life form that connects with the Earth? Can you also see that as such you would not exist without the existence of the universe? Astronomers are searching for life on other planets because it is so rare and extraordinary. Yet you are a life form that is the survivor of life from the very beginnings of simple life on this planet. You are extraordinary too, yet you probably have no idea of how you work because it is mostly unconscious. Maybe you have read about the body, but that is not the same as honouring and working with the life process that keeps you alive. Can you honestly say, “What the hell am I?” and listen and learn. For you are really what religion is about. You are the great mystery.</p><p>I witnessed an atheist talking to a woman he was confronting, “Religion;” he said, “that’s surely a direction for failures and people who can’t really cope with facing reality.”</p><p>And the woman he was accusing of this inability to face reality said, “You poor man! Is your mind or awareness so tiny that you have never realised the forces and processes of your own body are beyond anything you understand? Can’t you see that your very existence is brought about by things so far beyond your knowledge that it is only a statement of your impoverishment to suggest an awareness of God is an expression of some sort of smallness and failure. Have you never understood that? Have you not seen that religion is not only an acknowledgement of what we fail to understand and yet depend upon, but it is also an opening to it, a willingness to relate to it? It can also be something far more even than that. It can be an active loving relationship with what gives you life. And such love is an exchange, a sharing, and a way of merging one with another. It is an exchange – a sharing of bodily fluids – the very substance of life. Imagine that; a glorious love affair with the very spirit of life! A love affair with the invisible and forever indefinable. Is that something you are afraid of?”</p><p> </p></div><div class='entry'><h2>Ate</h2><p>See <strong><a href="http://dreamhawk.com/dream-dictionary/eating/">eating</a></strong></p></div><div class='entry'><h2>Astronaut</h2><p>This points to attitudes or feelings, perhaps even ideas, that can take you beyond the ordinary view you have of life and yourself. There is also a suggestion you are feeling the courage to grow and explore what you cannot yet define. See: <a href="http://dreamhawk.com/dream-dictionary/space/"><strong>Space</strong></a>.</p><p>This might link with efforts you are making in meditation or exploring your inner world of experiences beyond your body senses. Sometimes it reflects states of mind in which you split off from your body, perhaps in an attempt to run away from or avoid direct life experience. </p><p><b>Useful questions are: </b></p><p>What is it the astronaut or I am doing in this dream, and how might that relate to my waking activities? </p><p>Am I learning anything from the astronaut? </p><p>If I stand in the role of the astronaut what is my view of life and the world? </p></div><div class='entry'><h2>Astrologer Astrology</h2><p>The dream astrologer often represents your intuition or unconscious insights into yourself and others. There may also be a link with a sense of destiny or direction. But perhaps you associate astrology with hocus pocus, in which case your dream might be suggesting you are being misled.</p><p>To see, be, or have connections with an astrologer in your dream suggests you are in touch with your intuition, and may be having thoughts or concerns about your future. It can also indicate intuitions concerning your innate abilities or qualities, and where they might lead.</p><p>Astrology is a modern version of an ancient realisation about forces of cosmic origin that shape and influence our lives. Unfortunately most of ancient vision has been lost. But any mention of astrology in your dream may suggest that you are now receiving the cosmic impulses in your creative activities, which will lead your life to a fuller expression of your potential.</p><p>The more deeply those heavenly signs and their traditional significance’s are studied, the more impossible it appears to consider them as a human invention. In the first place they are more ancient than the earliest records of human history; they can be traced in the earliest dawn of civilisation. The most ancient legends of all peoples are based on them.</p><p>Everywhere throughout the world the “Signs,” their symbols, and significance are found practically identical. There are some slight modifications of the symbols to adapt them to local conditions; for instance, the “Bull” becomes an “Elephant” in India; the “Crab” is sometimes a “Tortoise,” in Egypt it was sometimes replaced by the scara­beus, but it remained a “Crab” in the planispheres of the great temples of Egypt at Denderah and Esme; the meanings of the signs were unchanged. The only change of any importance that ever appears to have been made was the substitution of the “Scorpion” for the “Eagle,” and that corresponded with one of the most important facts in the whole story of humanity, which can be more appropriately referred to later.</p><p>(During the <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Invasion_of_Egypt_(1798)" title="French Invasion of Egypt (1798)">Napoleonic campaign in Egypt</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominique_Vivant" title="Dominique Vivant">Vivant Denon</a> drew the circular zodiac, the more widely known one, and the rectangular zodiacs. In 1802, after the Napoleonic expedition, Denon published engravings of the temple ceiling in Denderah in his <i>Voyage dans la Basse et la Haute Egypte</i>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendera_zodiac#cite_note-6">[5]</a></sup> These elicited a controversy as to the age of the zodiac representation, ranging from tens of thousands to a thousand years to a few hundred, and whether the zodiac was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planisphere" title="Planisphere">planisphere</a> or an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrology" title="Astrology">astrological chart</a>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-7"></sup>)</p><p>How can we account for these signs and their traditional meanings. There is no conceivable way in which men in the earliest stages of civilisation could have obtained them from observation and experience. Uninterrupted observations over a complete Precessional Cycle, even if possible, would have been insufficient. And what could lead any primitive race of men even to imagine the possibility of any connection between the stars and their lives and destinies? Given the Zodiacal conception, its significance, and the key to “planetary” workings, by some form of “Revelation,” they would of course be able to observe its influences at work in human – and cosmic – affairs, but no human beings could ever have “invented” it. The only explanation of its origin which appears to be possible is that it was “revealed” to men in just exactly the same way as “prophecies” and all other spiritual mysteries, through the perceptive faculty of the unconscious mind at the period of its most complete activity.</p><p> Example: I dreamt my uncle Tony came to me. He asked where the toilet was and I described it. I discovered the sink was overflowing with water. P had left a tap running. When I looked however, the sink was within another sink, thus the floor was not wet. I believe I turned the taps off though.</p><p>My uncle talked to me. I noticed he had a wig on, it was also dyed black. He told me, or I knew that a group of businessmen wanted me to talk about astrology. At first I was merely going to give an “off-the-cuff” talk. Later however I began to want to really throw all I had into the talk, both off-the-cuff, and well researched talk.</p><p>The dreamer attempted to use intuition to understand the dream by exploring it intuitively not interpreting it intellectually by thinking about or looking up symbols: “The dream brings to your life the present possibilities. Bringing the possibilities to light. There was the time when you were never certain what to do with your life. Life brought pain. When this dream was lived, you were lost within yourself. The dream brought love into your life.</p><p>The first part of the dream lifts you from the recent darkness. When your uncle Tony arrives, this represents the coming from within yourself of those possibilities lost when you lost your way three years ago. You lost it them because you tried the path which left the world. There was lost the path your soul came to fulfill. You resisted the urge to teach the word. The word was lost within you. The word was my life calling you. When you resisted the call you decided to leave the world by trying to live the spiritual life. When you (recently) released love on this decision you received the power to speak the word.</p><p>The word will live within you. The life you will now live will be the word living in you. The way you live will let my world bring your world my light. The dream promises that you will bring the Star Light to many. The dream promises that you will lift many by telling them the wisdom you received from my word. The dream brings you my world.</p><p>There was, last night, the lifting of the mind. There will follow from this the possibility of lifting the mind in others. The dream was lived because you were receiving the power to speak from the word. The part where the water overflows means that the life force now flows freely. Nothing is hurt when it flows over. The present life will allow it to express without harm. It can be turned off or on as wished. The life force flows between the two sinks because they represent the two levels of physical existence, the outer and the inner. See <a href="https://dreamhawk.com/dream-encyclopedia/qs-question/"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Q’s Big Question</strong></span></a></p><p>The child – P – represents your present love, longing, and my life within you. The toilet is the creative self now clearing problems by flushing them away which were frustrating it. The wig is the false thinking, the unconscious false thoughts, still prevalent and to be dealt with.</p><p>When your uncle brings up the subject of astrology, this means that you are now receiving the cosmic impulses in your creative activities, which will lead you in your life activities. The part where you – plan to – speak to the group, brings your life work before you.

He seemed to be explaining to the children that the best way to help the animal was to see it in its true form and release it from its outer coverings. As he was explaining this he began undoing a zip along the length of the animal’s spine and peeled off what I could now see, was a kind of perfect fitting cloth suit, he repeated this action again, removing yet another suit and I am not sure whether he did so a third time, or how many times but eventually I saw the rich, shiny, chestnut coloured coat of a healthy animal. I am not sure at this point whether the animal was now a horse, it looked like a new born but not like a donkey so I think it may have been a horse. It then seemed that some kind of order had been restored, there now appeared a kind of arena and people were filling the seats to watch some kind of a play, As I watched the seats filling I realized there was not one for me and again I was standing in the sidelines, a watcher.</p><p><br class="spacer_"/></p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Idioms</span>: donkey work;</p><p><em> </em></p><p><em>Useful Questions and Hints:</em></p><p>If you consider that your relationship with the ass might indicate how you are dealing with your body, what does it suggest?</p><p>Are you feeling put upon by the needs or demands of others?</p><p>Is somebody trying to make you go in a direction you do not want to?</p><p>Are you being a donkey or an ass – i.e. a bit dense or silly?</p><p>See <a href="http://dreamhawk.com/inner-life/inner-world/"><strong>Inner World</strong></a> – <strong><a href="http://dreamhawk.com/dream-dictionary/practical-techniques-for-understanding-your-dreams/">Techniques for Exploring your Dreams</a> – <a href="http://dreamhawk.com/approaches-to-being/the-core-experience-part-1/">Your Core Self</a></strong></p><p><strong><br/>

You may receive important instructions or lessons from your own highest level – usually shown as a wise being or guru.</p><p>We are all dual beings. The one side of us we know as our conscious self, living in the waking world. That side is only a tiny and usually cut of self. We have another side of us that most people are unconscious of and is best thought of as a massive and integrated consciousness of everything and everybody.</p><p>Example: I woke early his morning to pee. As I woke I was aware of having been dreaming, but I could not remember what the dream was. However, I was experiencing a strong feeling of being connected with all things. I had a deep sense of being part of everything, and of everything being a part of me. It was very real and I had a spontaneous image of standing in a great garden, an immense place of creation and unity – the Garden of Eden feeling. As this happened I had an insight that most of the people in the world do not have, and perhaps do not want to be a part of this unity. This thought, in the way it was experienced was completely new to me. I couldn’t understand why anyone would not want to experience this wonder and communion. I knew I was at the wedding feast, the celebration of life or creation. It was a wonderful feeling to be a part of this mystery.</p><p>Therefore the realisation that many people did not want this was slightly shocking or unnerving. It made me ask myself the question of whether I was naive, perhaps not seeing or realising something. This realisation went on to the sense that in fact a sort of battle was going on between those who were part of the celebration, and those who didn’t want it. I thought that those who didn’t want it were perhaps frightened of losing the control they thought they had over their life and the world. I knew I was playing a part in this battle or struggle.</p><p>Example: A man – Jesse Watkins – stressed out of his normal awareness said – ““I was more than I had ever imagined myself. Not only was I living my life now, but I had existed from the very beginning of time, from the lowest form of life up to the present. The real me was all that experience. Then at times I could see ahead beyond even the awareness I now had, to where we become aware of it all.” Jesse felt that the new ‘world’  he was experiencing was something humans were moving toward, but most people couldn’t reach at the moment. In that world were beings Jesse called gods, beings who could live and move in that world easily, beings who were not afraid of the enormity of the experience. From this he felt that all the things that happen to us in our life are helping us evolve toward becoming like the gods Jesse met.</p><p>In the ashram you are part of the journey into the wider life. There are stages of the journey which are marked by initiations – a powerful l experience that allows you entrance to a new level of sharing the ALL.</p><p><em>Useful Questions and Hints:</em></p><p>What did you experience in connection with the ashram?</p><p>Was it difficult to get into the ashram?</p><p>Did you learn anything there?</p><p>In what way did you learn?</p><p>Try using <strong><a href="http://dreamhawk.com/dream-dictionary/practical-techniques-for-understanding-your-dreams/#TalkingAs">Talking As</a> – <a href="http://dreamhawk.com/dream-encyclopedia/processing-dreams/">Processing Dreams</a></strong></p><p><br class="spacer_"/></p></div><div class='entry'><h2>Ash Tree</h2><p>Because if its fantastic power of growth and survival it often represent your own personal growth and ability to survive and thrive despite attacks.

Such a shift from a lower mood or sensation to one felt as exhilarating or lighter is often shown as ascending.</p><p>In many past cultural traditions ascent was associated with purification or refinement – as in the ascent to heaven, or a holy mountain. It also suggested becoming more detached, or finding a different perspective. We could see it also as evolution of ourselves to a newer level. Because we often move to a wider view of things, becoming more aware of our situation or surroundings as we get higher, ascending is often linked with change, and perhaps leaving things behind, the dropping away of what occupied you below. It can also be an attempt to remove yourself from the difficulties or experiences of the world – there may be a link with losing touch with reality. See <strong><a href="http://dreamhawk.com/dream-encyclopedia/altered-states-of-consciousness/">Altered States of Consciousness</a>.</strong></p><p>Example: I was dreaming that I was walking around a small cul-de-sac early in the morning. I came up to a group of old women dressed in black huddled around a pentagram chanting something. I was terrified of them. For some reason I thought they were witches so I turned to run away. That is when they saw me and they started chasing after me. I started running but I wasn’t fast enough. They were right behind me. Than right before they were about to grab me I shot up into the air. Shortly after I was flying; it felt so freeing. Than for some reason I started trying to find god. I was shouting out for him and calling his name.  As I was calling out to him I saw a giant face in the clouds. It felt really powerful. It was a perfect face and I thought my call had been answered. – In the example the dreamer ascend to escape from terror.</p><p>The term ‘upwardly mobile also links ascent with success or a change toward greater fortune; moving toward achievement.</p><p>In some dreams or out of body experiences, the clear awareness of OBE is sometimes preceded by a feeling of rapidly moving upward. In such cases there is a sort of awakening, and ascending may in fact be an expression of nearing wakefulness. So ascending would be a move to waking, and descending moving toward deeper sleep or knowing the unconscious.</p><p>Jung points out that the theme of ascent is part of many ancient religious rituals and beliefs. In most cases the ascent is, like the rising sun during the day or the summer, linked completely with the descent in the evening, night, or winter. Ascent is therefore part of a spiral which also descends, the cycle of birth, death, rebirth. Christianity tends to speak of a one time resurrection however, whereas the ancient belies saw it as a continuing cycle.

And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep. And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it. And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ascending a hill or mountain or tree</span>: Often shows having a more inclusive view or understanding of one’s activities and place in the scheme of things. It also signifies purification or personal evolution. Ascent of a hill often appears in dreams of people in or approaching middle age, and depicts their life so far as an ascent.

It can also indicate going up in the world, so may link with ambition or achievement.

It could suggest the action of turning our feelings  inwards in a wounding way. Sometimes it means a message, perhaps of love or endeavour.</p><p>This is made clear in the following example.</p><p>As I looked at this beast I noticed that its eyes were being hurt. Arrows were being fired at its eyes, and javelins thrown. I wondered who could be doing this, and stepped forward to take out the javelins and the arrows.</p><p>I wondered what the arrows and javelins could be, and was it I throwing them, firing them? Gradually it clarified that we continually injure this wonderful process in us. Being aware is a special state that acts in all manner of ways for this great ancient being or process that is behind our existence. Consciousness is its eyes and ears, its fingers and mouth, its means of experience, and its way of learning. And whatever we feed back to that fundamental part of us is deeply felt. Perhaps this is not a very accurate description, but it is like a loving and willing dog that out of its instinctive being tries to do all that we ask of it, tries to grow, tries to learn. But it is so sensitive, so when we are angry with it, or frustrated, or direct criticism at it, it cowers, it feels failure, its exuberance diminishes. So also with this great wonderful beast within, this mysterious process of life that is at our core. It withdraws. But we can also call it out into further expression, enabling it to extend beyond its previous capabilities, by loving it, by acknowledging its wonder, by calling it forth.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><em>Useful Questions and Hints:</em></p><p>Have I been pierced or pierced others with arrows?</p><p>What do I feel about the dream?</p><p>What is it like to be the dream arrow or arrows?</p><p>Try <strong><a href="http://dreamhawk.com/dream-dictionary/practical-techniques-for-understanding-your-dreams/#TalkingAs">Talking As</a></strong> to find out.</p></div><div class='entry'><h2>Arrogant Arrogance</h2><p>It seems from looking at the dreams where arrogance is mentioned it is usually because we fail to see who we really are and so act in a way to get ourselves in trouble. The following example shows this.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p>By the way, I ultimately said “no” to antidepressant drugs that were recommended to me. Are these drugs as disastrous as I think they are? It seems to me they are impeding the evolution of our race by keeping tens of millions mentally and emotionally “stuck”. Sure, they reduce the pain, but for most people, an absence of pain decreases the motivation to explore their inner selves and return with some jewels of discovery.</p><p>I am quite certain that I released my demons prematurely – before I had sufficiently developed my strengths and skills. This happened because I didn’t listen to my inner self’s messages. In my arrogance, I actually thought I knew better. This led to my depression and opened the gates to my inner demons. So…I am now forced to fight a premature battle. In such a case, is there any room for the argument that antidepressants can act as a crutch to help your mind heal?
